Flask Server Template
====================================


This is the template which can be used to start a new API server in Flask.

Following things are used : 
- Flask-RESTful is used for REST APIs.
- One sample API is in userapi.py.
- Each API goes into separate class in apiserver dir.
- Any new API endpoint can be added in new file and endpoint to be mapped in main.py
- Pre-defined Logging setup is added. Logging settings are in common/settings.py, change as required.
